              Outside of software development, I'm a musicianâ€”I play piano,
              guitar, and sing. Music and coding share a common thread: both
              require creativity, precision, and a deep understanding of
              patterns. This balance between technical and creative work
              keeps me inspired.

              Whether it's launching a SaaS product, refining an open-source
              project, or solving complex data challenges, I'm always eager to
